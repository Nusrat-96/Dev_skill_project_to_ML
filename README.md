**Project Name:**    South Asian Seasonal Food Price Prediction and Check to See if Price is Within Limits
**Project Summary:** There are a total of seven input features to predict the price of the fruits. We use the linear regression algorithm to predict prices.
Then we utilize the predicted price to check if the price is within the limit or not. For this, we chose the logistic regression algorithm.
At last, we provide a sample to check the prediction value of the LR model.
